# clangml.4.0.0beta1: OCaml bindings for Clang API

We are happy to announce the first public beta of the new clangml
library. Clangml provides bindings for all versions of Clang, from 3.4
to 8.0.0.

In particular, Clangml allows OCaml program to use the Clang parser to
parse C/C++ code and get an abstract syntax tree annotated with type
information.

clangml can be installed via opam. Since the library relies on external
dependencies, we suggest to use the depext plugin to install it together
with the packages needed for your system:

  opam depext -i clangml

This library is a complete rewritting of the previous clangml (clangml
versions <4.0.0): the bindings now rely on automatically generated C
stubs to libclang, with some extensions when libclang is incomplete.

Contrary to old clangml versions, the versions of clangml from 4.0.0
are independent from the version of the Clang library: any version of
clangml from 4.0.0 can be built with any version of the Clang library
in the supported interval.  Currently, all versions of Clang, from 3.4
to 8.0.0, are supported.
