clangml

OCaml wrappers for clang.

To install the library: `./configure', then `make', then `make install'.

Requires dune: you may have to run `opam install dune' first.

Requires llvm-config: either llvm-config is in PATH, or you may
specify a path with `./configure --with-llvm-config=...'.

Requires bootstrap/ sub-directory: if the source directory is a git
clone from the development repository, you may run `./bootstrap.sh'
to get the bootstrap seed from the bootstrap branch. The stubgen tool
(sub-directory stubgen/) generates a new seed for a given llvm-config.
