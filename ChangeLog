# Next version

- Compatible with OCaml 4.10.0

- Typeloc structures which contains non-transformed type informations can be
  obtained with Clang.Decl.get_type_loc and Clang.Parameter.get_type_loc.
  In particular, typeloc structures can be obtained to get the original size
  expression from constant arrays.
  (suggested by Damien Rouhling)

- Clang.Expr.get_definition and Clang.Decl.get_canonical to retrieve the cursors
  to the declaration site of identifiers, and Clang.compare_cursors for
  comparing cursors.
  (suggested by Arthur Chargu√©raud)

- Bug-fix: Constant array sizes are no longer reported as default values for
  parameters.

- Ignore decorations in Clangml__compare

- Relies on `metaquot` and `refl`.
  `ppxlib` and `override` are not dependencies anymore.

# 2019-07-11, 4.0.0

- C++ support: all the code examples from C++14 and C++17 norms are covered
  by the AST.

- AST pretty-printers, comparators and lifters are now defined in sub-libraries
  (clangml.show, clangml.ord, clangml.lift). Visitors are no longer derived by
  default (`override` PPX library can be used to derive visitors from the AST
  if needed.)

- A very limited C/C++ pretty-printer is provided in the sub-library
  clangml.printer. It should be extended in next releases.

- Bug fixes
