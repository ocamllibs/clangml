# 2019-07-11, 4.0.0

- C++ support: all the code examples from C++14 and C++17 norms are covered
  by the AST.

- AST pretty-printers, comparators and lifters are now defined in sub-libraries
  (clangml.show, clangml.ord, clangml.lift). Visitors are no longer derived by
  default (`override` PPX library can be used to derive visitors from the AST
  if needed.)

- A very limited C/C++ pretty-printer is provided in the sub-library
  clangml.printer. It should be extended in next releases.

- Compatible with OCaml 4.08

- Bug fixes

- Flag dune as a build dependency
  (suggested by @kit-ty-kate in
   https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/pull/13434)

# 2019-02-11, 4.0.0beta1
